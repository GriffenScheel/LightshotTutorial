If you click take a screen shot you will begin taking a screenshot. But, if you would like to change up some settings click 'Options'.

STEP 3: Once you're done looking through the settings go ahead and close the options window and click the hot key you set for taking a screen shot. If you didn't go through the options the default hotkey to take a screenshot is the printscreen key.
Your screen should go gray and a text saying 'Select Area' should be following your mouse. Click and drag to make the area you want to be included in your screenshot. Once you have done this your screen should look something like this.

You can see Lightshot added two bars around your selection. 
The bar on the right side of the picture allows you to add things like text, color, highlights, shapes. 

The bar on the bottom lets you save the image, copy the image, and delete the image. It also allows you to upload the image to prntscrn.com and get a short cut link for people to click on and see the image in their web browser. 
Also it allows you to share the screenshot on social networks as well as search google for images that look related to your screenshot.

Thats it for the Lightshot tutorial though. We went through how to download and take a screenshot using Lightshot. We also went through how to go through the settings and mentioned the different little features lightshot gives to mess with our screenshot.
